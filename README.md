# <img src='./images/logo.svg' width=90 style="vertical-align:middle" /> SHAREing: Performance Assessment Templates

> [!WARNING]
> This repository is currently under development.

This repository contains Markdown templates to write reports for [SHAREing](https://shareing-dri.github.io/)'s
Performance Assessment service.

It also includes a Python package to generate graphics and metrics required to fill the report. Currently, it can only
be used for some of the rubrics in the high-level assessment.

## Pre-assessment

The [pre-assessment report](pre-assessment-report.md) is to be completed using information provided by the submitter.
The assessor must also report on their experiences with verifying the submitted code for the assessment, including the
settings and parameters used.

## High-level performance assessment

The high-level assessment covers the following 5 main rubrics:

1. Core
2. Intra-node
3. Inter-node
4. GPU
5. I/O

Details of how to conduct each performance measurement are given in
the [performance assessment guidebook](https://shareing-dri.github.io/performance-assessment/guidebook). An [
`example report`](examples/stencil-example-report.md) is also provided.

The `high-level-plots.py` script in the [`assessmenttemplate`](#the-assessmenttemplate-package) package can be used to
create the plots and metric required to fill out the [high-level assessment report](high-level-report.md).

## The `assessmenttemplate` package

The `assessmenttemplate` Python package and its few dependencies can be installed locally, or in a virtual environment
(recommended) optionally with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/packages/#installing-a-package), by running the command
in the repository's root directory:

```shell
pip install . # or uv pip install .
```

The package currently only contains modules to generate figures and metrics for that section of the high-level
assessment with the `high-level-plots.py` script :

```txt
usage: high-level-plots.py [-h] [--version] [-v] [-d] [--svg] [-i INPUT] [-o OUTPUT] [-s] [--show] {intranode,internode,summary} ...

Tools to generate plots for the high-level assessment.

positional arguments:
  {intranode,internode,summary}
                        Mode pertaining to the high-level rubric for which the plots are to be generated.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             Show program version number and exit.
  -v, --verbose         Print extra debug outputs.
  -d, --default         Output any requested outputs with unspecified file to their default file.
  --svg                 Output graph to default file will output SVG rather than PNG.
  -i, --input INPUT     Specify an optional input file containing the table for the metric.requested. Will use stdin if none specified.
  -o, --output OUTPUT   Specify an output file. This can only be used if exactly one output type is requested.
  -s, --stdout-graph    Output image data to stdout (useful for piping)
  --show                Show graph in window at runtime.

Processes commandline arguments and the input table containing intranode/internode runtimes per core/thread/node counts, or high-level metrics per rubric. Input can be either a Markdown table or a CSV. Produces the relevant
graph (line, point or spiderweb plot) and a Markdown formatted version of the input table with further processed data added (like parallel efficiency) if applicable. Unless an output flag is specified, a requested output will
be echoed to the standard console output.
```

The script currently offers three modes: [`intranode`](#intranode-and-internode), [
`internode`](#intranode-and-internode) and [`summary`](#summary). Further modules for the high-level, and scripts for
the low-level assessment will be added in due course as the methodology is developed. The
"Core" and "I/O" rubrics do not require significant calculations to complete so no associated scripts or modules will be
created for them. As of 09-09-2026, the workflows and measurements required for the GPU and internode metrics are still
being established.

### `intranode` and `internode`

Intra-node and inter-node performance analysis figures are generated using the `scaling` module accessed with
`high-level-plots intranode` and `high-level-plots internode` respectively. The usage information for the
`intranode` mode is provided below and `internode` uses the same arguments:

```txt
usage: high-level-plots.py intranode [-h] [-g [{cont,cat}]] [-m] [-c] [-a] [--graph-file GRAPH_FILE] [--markdown-file MARKDOWN_FILE] [--critical-points-file CRITICAL_POINTS_FILE]

Generate a strong scaling efficiency graph and table from intra-node runtimes.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -g, --graph [{cont,cat}]
                        Generate graph; either a continuous line plot (cont; default) or a categorical point plot (cat).
  -m, --markdown        Generate markdown table.
  -c, --critical-points
                        Calculate 80 and 60 percent critical values.
  -a, --output-all      Output all output types.
  --graph-file GRAPH_FILE
                        Specify an output file for the graph.
  --markdown-file MARKDOWN_FILE
                        Specify an output file for the markdown table.
  --critical-points-file CRITICAL_POINTS_FILE
                        Specify an output file for the calculated critical values.

Unless an output flag is specified, a requested output will be echoed to the standard console output.
```

In the `intranode` or `internode` modes, the script can take data input from the standard input, a unix pipe or a file.
The input is a table which can be in CSV or Markdown format. Suppose we have the following data saved as
`intranode_times.csv`:

```csv
Cores, Times
1, 29.995
2, 18.23
4, 10.74
8, 10.33
16, 9.1307
32, 8.5401
64, 7.4589
```

where the first column is the core count and the second is the time in seconds. The graph can be generated
interactively by running:

```shell
./high-level-plots.py intranode --graph # or -g
```

and pasting the data when prompted. The default is a continuous line plot. For a categorical point plot use
`--graph cont`.

The script can also generate a Markdown table which can be copied to the report. To
generate it along with the graph, the following commands can be used:

```shell
cat intranode_times.csv | ./high-level-plots.py -d intranode -mg --markdown-file=stdout
# N.B. `-gm` will not work as the `m` will be interpreted as an input to `-g`
```

```md
|   # Cores/threads |   Time (s) |   Parallel efficiency (%) |
|------------------:|-----------:|--------------------------:|
| 1                 | 29.995     | 1.000                     |
| 2                 | 18.230     | 0.823                     |
| 4                 | 10.740     | 0.698                     |
| 8                 | 10.330     | 0.363                     |
| 16                | 9.1307     | 0.205                     |
| 32                | 8.5401     | 0.110                     |
| 64                | 7.4589     | 0.063                     |
```

The script can also be provided a Markdown table in the above format as the input just like the CSV table. For
`intranode`, only the first two columns containing number of cores and execution time respectively will be read in.

By default (set with the `--default` or `-d` flag), the generated graph will be written to the [`images`](images)
directory.

The `scaling` module contains three useful functions which could be used for other modules:

1. `scaling_times_crit_80_60(times: list[tuple[int, float]]) -> tuple[float, float]` - this calculates the 80% and 60%
   efficiency points and returns them as a tuple
2. `scaling_times_to_graph(times: list[tuple[int, float]]) -> plt.Figure` - self-explanatory, generates the graph
3. `scaling_times_to_markdown(times: list[tuple[int, float]]) -> str` - this renders the core counts and times as a
   three-column Markdown table with core count, time, and parallel efficiency

Each function is passed the times as a list of tuples of core count and time taken.

### `summary`

The `summary` module contains functions to generate the rubric summary graphics for the report:

```txt
usage: high-level-plots.py summary [-h] [-b]

Generate a spiderweb diagram or bar graph for the SHAREing high-level performance assessment. Processes parsed commandline arguments and the input table containing summary metrics per rubric. Input can be either a Markdown
table or a CSV. Produces spiderweb plot and a Markdown formatted table of the summary metrics per rubric as outputs. :param unprocessed_args: Arguments from the parser to be further processed for the "summary" mode

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -b, --bar   Output a bar chart instead of a spiderweb.
```

When called with the `summary` mode, the `high-level-plots.py` script takes data input from the standard input, unix
pipe or input file the same way as the `scaling.py` mode, as either a CSV or Markdown table. It accepts an arbitrary
number of rows of "metric, score".

### Documentation

Generate documentation for the package with the following command:

```commandline
sphinx-build -M html docs/source/ docs/
```

## Contributions

This performance assessment is intentionally limited as we want to simply capture the performance of software at a *high
level*. However, if you have ideas of performance metrics which are necessary but missing, or if you find any faults
with the scripts or template, please raise an issue.
