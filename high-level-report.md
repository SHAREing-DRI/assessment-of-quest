## 1. Setup Details

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Indicate how the code was compiled, pointing out how it follows or differs from the pre-assessment and why. Add or remove subheadings based on what is relevant for the assessment and update the TOC accordingly.

### 1.1 Programming model
>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Indicate the programming model(s) being assessed in this report e.g. OpenMP+MPI, MPI+GPU, OpenMP GPU offloading etc.

The compiled code uses `<programming_model>` for both intra-node and inter-node runs. The submitter indicated a one MPI rank per NUMA domain preference.

### 1.2 SLURM configuration
>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Indicate the SLURM configuration(s) used for running the tests. Here you can point out the general configurations common among all runs, while the specific setups per rubric can be indicated in the relevant sections. This section can be removed if not applicable.

All analyses were performed on an exclusive node on `<cluster_name>` with the following configuration:

```bash
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=<num_mpi_ranks>
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=<num_cores>
#SBATCH --nodes=<num_nodes>
#SBATCH --exclusive
#SBATCH --distribution=block:block
```
>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Indicate other relevant settings, such as OpenMP environment variables, `likwid` arguments etc. here or under another subheading.

### 1.3 Base input
>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Indicate the general input settings used for running the tests. Rubric-specific settings such as problem size variables can be indicated in their relevant sections. This section can be removed if not applicable.

The following is the input configuration used for serial runs:

```txt
<general_input>
```

## 2. Core-level assessment
>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Include a brief description of the core-level rubric. Provide configurations and `likwid` utilities used to determine the core-level performance.

For a high-level analysis of a single core's performance, we look for the floating-point operation rate compared to the theoretical rate, $R^{core}_{theoretical}$ for a core. The hardware capabilities were determined with `likwid-bench` pinned to a single core on the first socket of a node:

```bash
likwid-bench -t peakflops -w S0:16kB:1
```

To analyse the performance of a single core, the code was run on one rank and thread with `likwid-perfctr` to get the observed floating point rate, with the [serial input indicated earlier](#13-base-input):

```bash
# Change accordingly for the code being assessed
likwid-perfctr -f -C 0 -g FLOPS_DP $EXEC $INPUT
```

>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Add the theoretical and observed floating point rates in the table below.
>
The observed and theoretical floating point rates were:

|       Metric              | MFLOPS    |
| ------------------------- | --------- |
| $R^{core}_{theoretrical}$ |           |
| $R^{core}_{observed}$     |           |

Based on these results, we determined that this software has a score of $C^{core} = \frac{R_{observed}}{R_{theoretical}}\approx$ `<core_score>`. As per the rubric, the metric is classified as follows:

| Peak FLOPS proportion | Description | Score |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| $C_{core} \ge$ 0.8 | <span style="background-color: #0080005f">Core performance does not require further analysis.</span> | |
| 0.8 $\gt C_{core} \ge$ 0.6 | <span style="background-color: #ffff005c">Core performance may require further analysis as it may not be effectively using the hardware to its maximum potential.</span> | |
| 0.6 $\gt C_{core}$ | <span style="background-color: #ff00004e">Core performance requires in-depth analysis.</span> | $C_{core} \approx$ `<core_metric>`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Place the core-level score in the correct range. Contextualise and elaborate on the classification of the score.

## 3. Intra-node assessment
>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Include a brief description of the intra-node rubric. Provide details on the programming model and the problem size used, how the core counts were varied, MPI rank, GPU and OpenMP thread assignments etc. for this code and assessment.

For a high-level analysis of the intra-node performance, we perform a strong scaling by fixing the problem size and increasing core allocation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Change the table headers and content according to the programming model used e.g. MPI only, OpenMP only, GPU + MPI etc.

| Cores | Ranks | Thread per rank | Time (s) | Parallel efficiency (%) |

The 80% threshold is at `<p_80>` cores and the 60% threshold is at `<p_60>` cores. As a proportion of the number of cores available on the node i.e. `<num_cores_per_node>`, the scores are:

$$
C^{80\\\%}_{intra}=\frac{p^{80\\\%}_{critical,intra}}{p_{max,intra}}=\frac{\texttt{<p\\\_80>}}{\texttt{<num\\\_cores\\\_per\\\_node>}}=\texttt{c\\\_80}\\\%
$$

and

$$
C^{60\\\%}_{intra}=\frac{p^{60\\\%}_{critical,intra}}{p_{max,intra}}=\frac{\texttt{<p\\\_60>}}{\texttt{<num\\\_cores\\\_per\\\_node>}}=\texttt{c\\\_60}\\\%
$$

| Efficiency                                                 | Description | Score |

## 4. Inter-node assessment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Include a brief description of the inter-node rubric. Provide more details on the programming model used for this code and assessment. Describe the initial problem size, and how it is scaled when the efficiency drops below 60%.

The inter-node performance is measured using a combination of strong and weak scaling analyses. For a given problem size, a strong scaling analysis is performed over increasing node counts, with the parallel efficiency computed with respect to the performance on a single node. When the efficiency drops below 60%, the problem size is increased relative to the initial size. The run is repeated with the new size for that node count, and the strong scaling analysis is continued over the remaining node counts. The step is repeated every time the efficiency falls below 60%.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Change the table headers and content according to the programming model used e.g. MPI only, OpenMP only, GPU + MPI etc. The "problem size" entry is relative i.e. the starting size will be 1, and if it is doubled when the parallel efficiency drops below 60%, it will be 2.

| Nodes | Ranks | Threads per rank | Problem size | Time (s) | Parallel efficiency (%) |
| ----- | ----- | ---------------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------------------- |
| 1     | 8     | 16               |              |          |                         |
| 2     | 16    | 16               |              |          |                         |

> Highlight any observations made from the inter-node runtimes and graph. Compute the scores using the metrics generated with the `assessmenttemplate` package and the `high-level-plots.py` script and plug the values in the equation below.

At `<N_example>` nodes, the parallel efficiency fell below 60% and so the problem size was doubled. The 80% threshold is at `<p_80>` cores and the 60% threshold is at `<p_60>` cores. As a proportion of the number of cores available on the node i.e. `<num_cores_per_node>`, the scores are:

$$
C^{80\\\%}_{inter}=\frac{p^{80\\\%}_{critical,inter}}{p_{max,inter}}=\frac{\texttt{<p\\\_80>}}{\texttt{<num\\\_cores\\\_per\\\_node>}}=\texttt{c\\\_80}\\\%
$$

and

$$
C^{60\\\%}_{inter}=\frac{p^{60\\\%}_{critical,inter}}{p_{max,inter}}=\frac{\texttt{<p\\\_60>}}{\texttt{<num\\\_cores\\\_per\\\_node>}}=\texttt{c\\\_60}\\\%
$$

| Efficiency | Description | Score |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----- |
| $C^{80\\\%}_{inter} \ge$ 0.8 $.C\_{inter}$ ^ $C^{80\\\%}\_{inter} + C^{60\\\%}\_{inter}=C\_{inter}$ | <span style="background-color: #0080005f">Distributed memory scaling does not require further analysis.</span> | $C^{80\\\%}\_{inter} \approx$ `<c_80>` & $C^{60\\\%}\_{inter} \approx$ `<c_60>` |
| $C^{60\\\%}\_{inter} \ge$ 0.6 $.C\_{inter}$ | <span style="background-color: #ffff005c">Distributed memory scaling may require further analysis.</span> | |
| otherwise | <span style="background-color: #ff00004e">Distributed memory scaling requires in-depth analysis.</span> | |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Place the inter-node score in the correct range. Contextualise and elaborate on the classification of the score.

## 5. GPU-performance assessment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Include a brief description of the GPU rubric. Provide details on the configurations and metrics collected from it. This rubric needs to be further generalised for other vendors such as AMD and accelerators such as FPGAs.

For a high-level analysis of a single GPU's performance, we look for the floating-point operation rate compared to the theoretical rate, $R^{GPU}_{theoretical}$ for the GPU, which can be obtained from [its specifications](https://www.nvidia.com/en-sg/data-center/h100/).

> [!TIP]
> The example uses NVIDIA H100s. Check the specifications for the GPU you are using for the assessment.

To analyse the performance of a single GPU, the code was compiled with the latest version of CUDA and NVHPC available on `<cluster_name>`. For this metric, the code was run on a single GPU and assigned the [input indicated earlier](#13-base-input) with the following modifications:

```txt
<example_gpu_input>
```

The following command was used to obtain the metrics required:

```bash
# Change accordingly for the code being assessed
ncu --metrics "regex:ˆsm_.*d_op_(d|f[ˆp]|h).*\\.sum$" --csv --log-file out.csv $EXEC $INPUT
```

|       Metric                                         | # operations  |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `sm__sass_thread_inst_executed_op_dfma_pred_on.sum`  |               |
| `sm__sass_thread_inst_executed_op_dmul_pred_on.sum`  |               |
| `sm__sass_thread_inst_executed_op_ffma_pred_on.sum`  |               |
| `sm__sass_thread_inst_executed_op_fadd_pred_on.sum`  |               |
| `sm__sass_thread_inst_executed_op_fmul_pred_on.sum`  |               |
| `sm__sass_thread_inst_executed_op_fmul_pred_on.sum`  |               |
| `sm__sass_thread_inst_executed_op_hfma_pred_on.sum`  |               |
| `sm__sass_thread_inst_executed_op_hadd_pred_on.sum`  |               |
| `sm__sass_thread_inst_executed_op_hmul_pred_on.sum`  |               |

The total runtime for the configuration without profiling was `<gpu_runtime>`.

>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Total the number of operations for each category and use the runtime without profiling to get the observed floating point rate. Add that to the table below along with the theoretical rate from the specifications of the GPU being used.
>
The observed and theoretical floating point rates were:

|       Metric              | MFLOPS                             |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| $R^{GPU}_{theoretrical}$  |                                    |
| $R^{GPU}_{observed}$      | $\frac{\sum N_{opers}}{T_{exec}}=$`<gpu_observed>` |

Based on these results, we determined that this software has a score of $C^{GPU} = \frac{R_{observed}}{R_{theoretical}}\approx$ `<gpu_score>`. As per the rubric, the metric is classified as follows:

| Peak FLOPS proportion | Description | Score |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| $C_{GPU} \ge$ 0.8 | <span style="background-color: #0080005f">GPU performance does not require further analysis.</span> | |
| 0.8 $\gt C_{GPU} \ge$ 0.6 | <span style="background-color: #ffff005c">GPU performance may require further analysis as it may not be effectively using the hardware to its maximum potential.</span> | |
| 0.6 $\gt C_{GPU}$ | <span style="background-color: #ff00004e">GPU performance requires in-depth analysis.</span> | $C_{GPU} \approx$ `<gpu_metric>` |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Place the GPU-performance score in the correct range. Contextualise and elaborate on the classification of the score.

## 6. I/O Assessment

For the I/O performance, we look for the proportion of the runtime spent processing I/O requests. On`<cluster_name>`, the I/O performance was determined with the `darshan` tool. The code was run on `<num_cores_per_node>` cores. To obtain the I/O metrics from `darshan`, the following configurations were used:

```shell
# Change accordingly for the code being assessed and the system used
module load <modules>
export DARSHAN_DIR=<darshan_dir>
export DARSHAN_LOGDIR=darshan_logs
LD_PRELOAD=${DARSHAN_DIR}/lib/libdarshan.so $EXEC $INPUT
```

The following relevant I/O metrics were extracted from the `darshan` logs:

| Metric                     | Time(s)  |
| -------------------------- | -------- |
| `total_POSIX_F_READ_TIME`  |          |
| `total_POSIX_F_WRITE_TIME` |          |

The I/O score, $C_{I/O}$, was computed as follows:

$$
C_{I/O}=1.0-\frac{t_{read} + t_{write}}{t_{total}}=\texttt{<io\\\_score>}
$$

| I/O proportion | Description | Score |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| $C_{I/O} \ge$ 0.8 | <span style="background-color: #0080005f">I/O does not require further analysis.</span> | $C_{I/O} \approx$ `<io_score>` |
| 0.8 $\gt C_{I/O} \ge$ 0.6 | <span style="background-color: #ffff005c">I/O forms a significant part of the total runtime and may require further analysis.</span> |
| 0.6 $\gt C_{I/O}$ | <span style="background-color: #ff00004e">I/O requires in-depth analysis.</span> |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Place the I/O score in the correct range. Contextualise and elaborate on the classification of the score.
