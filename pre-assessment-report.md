## 2. Benchmark setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section should be composed of information provided by the submitter.

### 2.1 Fetch and build program

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Provide commands to fetch and build the program. Include version numbers where possible.

The submitter has requested an assessment of `<repository/program_name>`, version `<version_number`>/branch
`<branch_name>`. It can be fetched/installed as follows:

```bash
# Example 1: Install specific version with a package manager
spack install <program_name>@<version_number>

# Example 2: Clone a specific branch of a repository
git clone -p <branch_name> <repository> && make release
```

### 2.2 Fetch and run benchmark

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Provide commands to fetch and run the benchmark. If it is directly provided by the submitter, note that here and upload it to the assessment repository if permitted. In the latter case, or if the benchmark is bundled with the code (i.e. no fetching is required), you may change to the heading to "2.2 Run benchmark".

The benchmark can be obtained from:

```bash
git clone <benchmark_repository>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Provide instructions on how to run the benchmark and indicate the expected I/O.

To run the benchmark:

```bash
cd <benchmark_folder>
mpirun -np 24 <program_executable> <benchmark_name> <output_file>
```

The following output is expected every `<n>` iterations:

```txt
<example-output>
```

### Reference architecture

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Add details of the reference architecture as provided by the submitter. Add any relevant details you may find
regarding the architecture/system online. If the same system is accessible to you for the assessment, then indicate that
here and detail the information in the [next section](#31-hardware-information).

## 3. Description of working environment

### 3.1 Hardware information

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Add the hardware information used, including where applicable the queue information if necessary. Comment on expected
normal limit for the hardware, e.g. size of the largest interconnected set of nodes, or memory limitations. Compare with
the reference architecture (if different), indicating any issues you may expect to see due to the differences.

The `<cluster_name>` system based at `<university/organisation>` was used for this assessment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Provide processor, memory and cache information as well as interconnect information (e.g. Infiniband, NVlink - if
across multiple nodes) of the system the assessment is to be performed on.

The hardware details for `<cluster_name>` are `[available at](<URL>)`. This information is corroborated by running
`cat /proc/cpuinfo` on one of the compute nodes via an interactive session. There are `<num_nodes>` compute nodes on the
system:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The table below is an example and should be adapted for "non-standard" architectures, e.g. systems with Grace Hopper
nodes. A placeholder for hardware accelerators is provided. For most assessment projects, these are likely to be GPUs
(generally Nvidia or AMD). But some cases may also work with FPGAs, ASICs etc. Include any relevant specifications.

| Specification             | Per node                                                                     |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Processors                | `<num_procs>` $\times$ `[<processor_name>](<link-to-online-details>)`        |
| `<Hardware accelerators>` | `<num_gpus/fpgas>` $\times$ `[<accelerator_name>](<link-to-online-details>)` |
| Clock speed per CPU       | `<freq>`MHz                                                                  |
| Sockets                   | `<num_sockets>`                                                              |
| Cores                     | `<num_cores>`                                                                |
| RAM                       | `<memory_size>`GB `<memory_type>`                                            |
| Local storage             | `<storage_size>`GB `<storage_type>`                                          |

> [!TIP]
> Add details that you can obtain from the system or online information about sockets, NUMA regions, interconnects and
cache sizes.

### 3.2 Libraries and modules

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Provide information on the libraries that need to be installed or modules that must be loaded based on the compilation
information provided by the submitter.

### 3.3 Assessment tools

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> 1. Limit pre-assessment tools to those with very low runtime. Mostly just focus on whether the program is running as
     expected. Do not assess the results of the benchmark for correctness as that requires domain-specific knowledge.
> 2. High level assessment tools and techniques which are expected to be useful, like global measures such as wall time.
> 3. If additional information is provided, you can address the low-level assessment that may be required, and if you
     may require privileges on the system. Only address this section if you confident that enough domain information has
     been provided, with respect to scaling of the compute and memory with the problem size.

1. Pre-assessment:
    - `<tool_1>`
    - `<tool_2>`

2. High-level assessment:
    - `<tool_1>`
    - `<tool_2>`

3. Low-level assessment:
    - `<tool_1>`
    - `<tool_2>`

## 4. Compiler setup and optimisations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Based on the compilation information provided by submitter, comment on the following (where applicable):
>
> - package manager (e.g. `spack`)
> - build toolchain (e.g. `cmake`)
> - main compiler version (e.g. GCC 11)
> - compiler optimisations (e.g. -O3, `--fast-math`)
> - additional accelerator libraries and versions (e.g. SYCL revision 11, Kokkos 5.1)
> - any feature sets which are toggled on (e.g. vectorisation)
>
> Add additional information about the impact of optimisations on convergence or correctness of results if provided by
the submitter. If there are any issues with compatibility on the machine you are testing on, or any build issues
experienced, provide details

Build instructions from the user `<build_toolchain>` to build the `<program_name>` with `<optimisation_level>`.

> [!tip]
> MAQAO should present missed compiler optimisation opportunities. Increasing the optimisation level may require
re-converging the system to confirm accuracy. This may be outside the scope of the assessment.

## 5. Computational complexity and scaling

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Comment on the possibility of scaling the problem up and down, both in strong (changing number of work units e.g.
CPUs, but keeping the problem size constant) and weak (changing the problem size but keeping number of work units the
same) contexts. Add any information provided by the submitter regarding the scaling of _computation (i.e. work)_,
_memory_ and _execution time_ as the problem size or work units are increased.
>
> If there is existing scaling information (graphs or raw data) available, attach it to this report or add links to
access it.

The `<parameter>` value can be varied to increase the problem size for scaling tests.

## 6. Memory, storage and I/O

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Comment on the expected in memory size of the program at runtime, including data. An estimate of this information
should be provided as part of the submission. For jobs submitted to Hamilton as part of early assessment, the Hamilton
dashboard can be used to gauge memory usage
(see [Hamilton Portal Performance](https://www.durham.ac.uk/research/institutes-and-centres/advanced-research-computing/hamilton-supercomputer/usage/portal/performance/)).

According to the submitter, the expected memory required for the benchmark is `<memory_size>`GB.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Comment on the expected storage requirements of the program, are there large amounts of temporary files (either in
quantity or in total size)? An estimate of this information should be provided as part of the submission. A program that
produces a large amount of temporary checkpoint files should have checkpoints turned off where possible.

The benchmark also outputs files totalling `<storage_size>`MB.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Comment on the expected output, including when the I/O is performed, and your observations when running the benchmark.
This output should be minimal when testing the working performance of the program rather than the I/O saturation.
Excessive I/O will result in an inaccurate performance assessment and may result in rejection.

The benchmark writes to the console output every `<n>`
iterations [as indicated by the submitter](#22-fetch-and-run-benchmark).

## 7. Additional comments from submitter

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Include any additional information from the submitter that does not fit the previous sections.

## 8. Pre-assessment outcome

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Indicate whether the assessment will proceed to the high-level stage. If the assessment is rejected here, comment on why and how to proceed.
